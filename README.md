Serializer
==========

Official [documentation](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer).

This fork is used to fix a bug in a legacy project which still has a PHP 5.3.x requirement but needs to work with PHP 5.6.
The issue was fixed in official 1.0 release (https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer/pull/431).
